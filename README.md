# CFG (Team Black)
a CNN model for object detection in the CFG MACHINE LEARNING CHALLENGE 2023

### to do:
- add more images to laptop-sample-dataset (from drive)
- build the CNN model
- train the model
- evaluate the model
- make predictions

#### goals:
identify as many as you can of these items or letters explicitly in any image provided
make it easy to supply in new images and report visible objects from the list
(determine the number of each of these items in a picture)
(identify other items outside of the list)

#### objects:
laptop | monitor | keyboard | mouse | football | ball (soccer ball) | bee | train | letter M | letter T
